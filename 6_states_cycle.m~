%I have 6 states from that email. Lets see what I can do with them. Hmm...
total_states = 6 ;

%Random sizes and times for 1D initialization.
size = 21;
time = 21;

%TYPE AND SIZE DEFINITION
A = ones(time,size);
A(1,:) = randi([1 total_states],1,size);


%B is A for cyclic
B = A;

%
%Now what I am going to do is, I am going to have a ruleset and then when I
%am going to compare the results for graphs that have cycles and graphs
%that do not have cycles! And then I will change the initializations and
%the rulesets to see where that takes us.

%THREE THINGS THAT CAN COMPLETELY DEFINE FATE FOR OUR DETERMINISTIC MODEL:
    %GRAPH
    %RULESET
    %INITIALIZATION

%RULE
%The ruleset here is the new state when a cell receives a signal
%First line is change in state when you do receive a signal
%Second line is a change in state when you do not receive a signal

%GRAPH FOR ACYCLIC - LEBON ET AL
graph = zeros(total_states,total_states);

%The graph from the lauren paper is the following DAG

          1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 ] ;
      

final = rule .* graph ;
          



%A graph with a cycle so we can see a comparision
